## Hi there 👋, I'm Michel Versiani AKA Versiani and I'm a Software Developer
27 years old , graduated in Systems Analysis and Development at Estácio De Sá University, 4 years of experience building software, specialized in Backend.

Most part of my experience as a developer consists on creating REST APIS , cron jobs and API integrations using languages and tools such as PHP, NodeJS, Laravel, always striving to apply best practices from software development into each project.

I believe that building a software is like an art , therefore , we should always look foward to make the code as clean and reliable as possible and always sticking with the right architectural patterns for each application. I believe that as a blacksmith forges his best blade , not only to cut , but to look amazingly done aswell , we need to build software , bringing value to the current company that we 're working on 🤓.
